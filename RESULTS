# Daily Step Count and Social Media Usage Relationship Test
As a result of the hypothesis test I conducted to test my hypothesis that there is a negative relationship between the time spent on social media and the number of steps taken
per day, it was determined that there is indeed a relationship between social media use and the number of steps taken per day.
The test result is shown in more detail as follows:

Hypotheses:
H0: Step count increase does not significantly reduce social media usage.
HA: Step count increase significantly reduces social media usage.

Hypothesis Testing Results:
Spearman Correlation Coefficient: -0.3190
P-Value: 0.0327

Conclusion:
Reject the null hypothesis (H0): There is a significant relationship between step
count and social media usage.
