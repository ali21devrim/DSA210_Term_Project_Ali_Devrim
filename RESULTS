# Daily Step Count and Social Media Usage Relationship Test
As a result of the hypothesis test I conducted to test my hypothesis that there is a negative relationship between the time spent on social media and the number of steps taken
per day, it was determined that there is indeed a relationship between social media use and the number of steps taken per day.
The test result is shown in more detail as follows:

Hypotheses:
H0: Step count increase does not significantly reduce social media usage.
HA: Step count increase significantly reduces social media usage.

Hypothesis Testing Results:
Spearman Correlation Coefficient: -0.3190
P-Value: 0.0327

Conclusion:
Reject the null hypothesis (H0): There is a significant relationship between step
count and social media usage.

# Temperature and Daily Step Count Relationship Test
Since the daily step count is most concentrated at 11 degrees, is 11 degrees the optimum temperature for my physical activity or is this a coincidence? I conducted a t-test to
understand this. 
Detailed results are below:

Hypotheses:
H0: When the air temperature is above 11°C, the daily average step count is not different from the general average.
HA: When the air temperature is above 11°C, the daily average step count is different from the general average.

Normal distribution test results:
Air temperature is above 11°C: p-value = 0.3228
Air temperature is 11°C and below: p-value = 0.2899

Independent Sample t-Test Results:
Test Statistics: -1.0055
p-value: 0.3202

Result: H0 cannot be rejected. When the air temperature is above 11°C, the daily average step count is not different from the general average.

Weather and Daily Step Count Relationship Test

ANOVA Test Result:
F-statistic: 0.5276
p-value: 0.5938

Hypotheses:
H0: Weather has no effect on the number of steps.
HA: Weather has an effect on the number of steps.

Result: H0 cannot be rejected. Weather has no significant effect on the number of steps.


#GENERAL CONCLUSION
When we look at the results of the three tests I applied, I see that the predictions I made at the beginning of the project were incomplete or incorrect at some points,
although not completely. While my prediction that there was a negative relationship between social media use and physical activity was correct, I learned that I had 
incorrectly predicted that weather conditions had a significant effect on physical activity. As a result, I think that both the issues I was right and wrong about have
positive data. Because these tests showed me that I did not need a condition like the weather to do physical activity. At the same time, I saw that when I increased my 
physical activity, my social media use decreased, meaning that physical activity was really beneficial.
